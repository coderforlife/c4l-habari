This repo is lacking all content and missing the config.php from a functioning system but otherwise is good to go. For additional utility, httpd-c4l.conf must be included by Apache. LICENSE and NOTICE, along with the docs submodule, are removed for use in a production environment.

Mostly changes to "user", however some changes to system and the root directory as well.

See [our wiki](http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Habari_on_github) for an in-depth description of the various ways you can get and manage your Habari instances. [The wiki](http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Main_Page) also has much more information, including how to customize Habari and where to get help.
